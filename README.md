The Offical mobile application for the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Music Festival.

HSB is America's largest free and non-commercial Music Festival, set in beautiful Golden Gate State Park on the first weekend of October each year since 2001.

True to the nature of HSB, this app focuses on providing fans all the information they need regarding the festival, a map, FAQ, and sortable customizable schedule. The intention is to provide the community with easy-to-use tools that people can check quickly and then get back to enjoying the music and celebrating with other festival-goers.

It is built with Ionic, AngularJS and wrapped with Cordova to provide a native experience. The app is in both the Apple App Store and Google's Play Store.
